# ch3ss-v2
This is a cheat program for online chess games. Currently working fine on chess.com. If you want to modify settings you will have to go in and change some variables, sorry.

to install:
`npm install`

to run:
`node index.js`

A test browser should automatically open, if not try installing puppeteer manually.
After each game you have to refresh as I have not implemented another way to reset it. Only games on the initially browser tab will be modified, if you go to a new tab it will not work.
